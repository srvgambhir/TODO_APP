# TrackIT

A TODO List application for Desktop (Windows, Linux, or macOS)

Do you ever get frustrated with to-do lists and end up missing assignments? Do you wish your to-do list let you customize priorities, due dates, and sorting? Well then, TrackIT is the app for you!

TrackIT allows users to keep __track__ of the items you need to do. With TrackIT, you can organize your todo's into different groups, priorities, different due dates, and so much more! We have manual sorting for you, and best of all: multiple hotkeys! If you can do it in the app, you can do it with a hotkey.
